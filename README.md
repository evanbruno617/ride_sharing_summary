# Ride Sharing Summary

## Overview
---
The purpose of this summary is to use the city and ride data from [Ride_Data](https://github.com/evanbruno617/ride_sharing_summary/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv), and [City_Data](https://github.com/evanbruno617/ride_sharing_summary/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) to create a summary of the ride-sahring data by city type; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Then by creating a graph that depicts the fares for each city type it will depict how each type of city performs throughout the months.

## Analysis
---
The total rides vary destrically among the city types with urban having by far the most with suburban having the second most and rural having the least. urban has almost twelve times the amount of total rides compared to Rural cities. This difference leads to the drastic variances in other values as well. This leads to far more drivers and more total fares in urban cities compared to Suburban and rural. However, since there are fewer drivers in rural areas the prices go up. This shows that in rural areas the rides tend to be longer and therefore cost more compared to city areas where the distance to the destination is shorter. However since there are less drivers in the more rural cities then their average is higher. ![sc](https://github.com/evanbruno617/ride_sharing_summary/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-03-01%20at%209.43.45%20PM.png)

## Summary
---
Considering that there is such a big difference among these city types I believe there are a couple solutions to maximize profits. 
1. For the rural areas the number of rides is fairly low with the price per ride by much higher. I believe if we asjust the demand per city typ to the price we will be able to recieve maximum profit. By decreasing the rate in the rural cities and slightly in suburban cities the demand could potentially go up leader to more rides and therefore a higher amount of total fares. For the urban cities the demand is very high with drivers making below the average ride cost. If we increase the price here we would be able to increase our total fare here without significantly decreasing the total rides. According to the chart ![CHart](https://github.com/evanbruno617/ride_sharing_summary/blob/main/Resources/fig.png) we can decrease or increase the cost accordingly based upon whether the fares increase or decrease in a given month.
2. Another option is increasing or decreasing the amount of drivers based on the city type. The more rural and suburban cities high fare cost can be decreased by adding more drivers to those cities. This will allow for more rides to take place since out there it normally takes longer to complete. This can therefore lead to increase the number of rides and increase fares in these regions.
3. Another way to increase fares in the suburban and rural areas advertise in those areas in order to increase the amount of rides. Can put out ads in shows in that location or special promotions and deals as well.
